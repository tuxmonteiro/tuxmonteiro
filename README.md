### 🗿 About Me  

I'm a **Cloud Architect and System/Software Engineer** passionate about **Cloud Computing, Cybersec, SRE, PaaS, backend development, and problem-solving** 😎. Deep experience in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and DevSecOps, leading several critical projects.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Cloud Computing**: AWS (I'm AWS Certified Solution Architect Professional and DevOps Enginner Professional) and GCP
- **Software Engineer**: Java (raw and Spring framework), Python and Shell scripting expertise (but with experience with Clojure, Kotlin, Go, and C++)
- **Kubernetes**: Using AWS EKS, GCP GKE, Rancher, Cilium, and more. In prehistory I used pure docker, but I'm currently a podman enthusiast.
- **Linux** since 1999 (Red Hat Certified Engineer in 2003) and currently in a love affair with Ubuntu. Proud sysadmin and kernel compiler in spare time.

## 🎯 Projects experiences

- Cloud Automation with Terraform, Ansible, NewRelic, Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana, and others.
- Low level networking and Multi-layer protocols using TCP, UDP, HTTP, SSL/TLS, Rest API, WebSocket, gRPC, and RSocket
- IaaS/PaaS Load Balancer (L4/7 Router, CDN, API Gateway, more)
- Data Engineering (including ETL, Avro/Parquet Data Lake management, Spark infra, more)
- Kubernetes clusters as a Service and deployment pipeline. Deep experience with K8S Management
- Virtualization using KVM/XEN/Vmware
- Trading systems and stock simulator (included FIX protocol)

## ✨ What I Work On  

- **Staff Engineer** - Leadership to improve tech teams, promoting an environment of critical thinking/data-driven approach, continuous learning and strong relationships with the business.
- **SRE Culture** - Help implement the SRE culture, evolving the perception of business reliability, reinforcing its reputation and customer happiness.
- **Decision Documentation Promoter** - Promoting RFC and ADR docs as the best way to discuss and record architectural design ideas and ensure that decisions and their context stand the test of time.
- **Software Development** – Backend engineering, Network engineering, APIs, and system design.
- **Cloud & DevOps** – Improving cloud effciency, reliability and cost (strong experience with AWS, but also involved in projects using GCP and Azure)
- **Exploring** – New frameworks, new cloud and software architectures, Blockchain, Rust and Scala languages, and AI-powered solutions (LLM focus).
